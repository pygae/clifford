    abstractNote = {We show how to compute the inverse of multivectors in finite dimensional real Clifford algebras Cl(p, q). For algebras over vector spaces of fewer than six dimensions, we provide explicit formulae for discriminating between divisors of zero and invertible multivectors, and for the computation of the inverse of a general invertible multivector. For algebras over vector spaces of dimension six or higher, we use isomorphisms between algebras, and between multivectors and matrix representations with multivector elements in Clifford algebras of lower dimension. Towards this end we provide explicit details of how to compute several forms of isomorphism that are essential to invert multivectors in arbitrarily chosen algebras. We also discuss briefly the computation of the inverses of matrices of multivectors by adapting an existing textbook algorithm for matrices to the multivector setting, using the previous results to compute the required inverses of individual multivectors.},

@techreport{lasenby-covariant-approach,
    title = {A {Covariant} {Approach} to {Geometry} using {Geometric} {Algebra}},
    abstract = {This report aims to show that using the mathematical framework of conformal geometric algebra – a 5-dimensional representation of 3-dimensional space – we are able to provide an elegant covariant approach to geometry. In this language, objects such as spheres, circles, lines and planes are simply elements of the algebra and can be transformed and intersected with ease. In addition, rotations, translation, dilations and inversions all become rotations in our 5-dimensional space; we will show how this enables us to provide very simple proofs of complicated constructions. We give examples of the use of this system in computer graphics and indicate how it can be extended into an even more powerful tool – we also discuss its advantages and disadvantages as a programming language. Lastly, we indicate how the framework might possibly be used to unify all geometries, thus enabling us to deal simply with the projective and non-Euclidean cases.},
