    "This notebook demonstrates how to use `clifford` to implement rotations in three dimensions using euler angles, rotation matices and quaternions. All of these forms are derived from the more general rotor form, which is provided by GA.   Conversion from the rotor form to a matrix representation is shown, and takes about three lines of code. We start with euler angles. "
